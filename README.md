This is the output from my BIK-PSI class.

Students get the overview of protocols, technologies, and algorithms necessary to communicate in computer networks, focusing primarily on the 2nd-4th layers of the ISO/OSI model.

A basic understanding of communication media, security, and network administration is presented.

Students will configure fundamental protocols in the local area network (LAN) and a connection to the Internet (WAN).
